bio: "Hello there, my name is Gavin and I'm a minimalist designer, front end developer, and coffee enthusiast. I first started my tech career in 2010, primarily focused on web development and web design. In 2013, I interned at a top 10 startup incubator, Gener8tor. Gener8tor allowed me to work with many different companies on a variety of different web projects. In 2013, my focus shifted from web design/development to mobile interface and experience design.<br><br>
From 2014â€“2015, I led design at a Los Angeles startup called Taplet. Within the first year, Taplet raised $1m in startup seed funding and generated 30,000 downloads within the first week of being released on the app store. One of the main products I worked on during my time at Taplet was Joyspace. This app became the flagship app by Taplet.<br><br>
Currently, I am leading design at a startup in Wilmington NC called Likeli. Big things are on it's way, so stay tuned!"
